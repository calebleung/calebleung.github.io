                    <h3>Auto Steam Queue</h3>
                    <p>
                        I am extremely fond of automation and its positive effect on quality of life. The <em>Auto Steam Queue</em> tool was originally created for personal use and shared on a whim. While I was merely automating my single Steam account, others have told me that they use it on hundreds of accounts, greatly improving their ability to gain Steam trading cards during seasonal sales.

                    <h3>Dive Master</h3>
                    <p>
                        The wiki for Guild Wars 2 is incredibly extensive. Easily accessed from in-game, it is an excellent resource for its players. However, as it is a wiki for all players, none of this information is personalized. This can be an issue for multi-step achievements such as Dive Master.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I created the <em>Dive Master</em> browser extension to alleviate the problem. Using the game's API, I added a personalized column into the Dive Master wiki page which indicates that player's progress with the achievement. Considering that the in-game help for this achievement only reports whether a player has completed "spot #n," this checklist is a vast improvement to a player's experience.

                    <p>
                        Have you ever had an idea stuck in your head that wouldn't go away until you executed on it? The <em>Link Shortner</em> project was just that. As the name suggests, it is a link shortner proof-of-concept. Shortlinks for http(s) via GETs and POSTs all while using Google Safe Browsing to safeguard against being used to send users to malicious content.

                            Another way to avoid creation of intermediate Immutable maps is to create a mutable copy of this collection. Mutable copies always return this, and thus shouldn't be used for equality. Your function should never return a mutable copy of a collection, only use it internally to create a new collection. If possible, use withMutations as it provides an easier to use API.
